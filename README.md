Submission foe the freeCodeCamp assignment https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/exercise-tracker

I realized afterwards that the sample.env file that was provided initially likely was intended as a template rather than to be used in the way that I did it, but as the code in this repository reflects the code I submitted and got a pass on, I left it as it is.

I did leave out the actual username and password in the Github repository part of my submission though.
